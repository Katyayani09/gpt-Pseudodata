Here are the schemas for the two tables:\n\n`ethereum.core.ez_nft_sales`:\n- `block_number`: The block number at which the NFT event occurred.\n- `block_timestamp`: The block timestamp at which the NFT event occurred.\n- `tx_hash`: The transaction hash for the NFT event. This is not necessarily unique in this table as a transaction may contain multiple NFT events.\n- `event_type`: The type of NFT event in this transaction, either `sale`, `bid_won` or `redeem`.\n- `platform_address`: The address of the exchange used for the transaction.\n- `platform_name`: The name of the exchange used for the trade. Currently, the exchanges supported are `opensea`, `looksrare`, `larva labs`, `blur`, `rarible`, `x2y2`, `sudoswap`, and `nftx`.\n- `seller_address`: The address of the seller of the NFT in the transaction.\n- `buyer_address`: The address of the buyer of the NFT in the transaction.\n- `nft_address`: The contract address of the NFT.\n- `project_name`: The name of the NFT project. This field, along with metadata, will be filled in over time.\n- `tokenid`: The token ID for this NFT contract.\n- `token_metadata`: The token metadata for this NFT. This may be blank for many NFTs. We are working to expand this field.\n- `currency_symbol`: The token symbol for this NFT event.\n- `currency_address`: The token contract address for this NFT event. This will be `ETH` for native ETH transactions.\n- `price`: The amount of the NFT event in the currency in which the transaction occurred, decimal adjusted where possible.\n- `price_usd`: The amount of the NFT event in US dollars. This will be 0 for tokens without a decimal adjustment or hourly price.\n- `total_fees`: The total amount of fees paid relating to the NFT purchase in the transaction currency. This includes royalty payments to creators and platform fees. Please note, this does not include the gas fee.\n- `platform_fee`: The decimal adjusted amount of fees paid to the platform for this NFT event in the transaction's currency.\n- `creator_fee`: The decimal adjusted amount of fees paid to the NFT collection as royalty payments for this NFT event in the transaction's currency.\n- `total_fees_usd`: The total amount of fees paid relating to the NFT purchase in US dollars. This includes royalty payments to creators and platform fees. Please note, this does not include the gas fee.\n- `platform_fee_usd`: The amount of fees paid to the platform for this NFT event in US dollars.\n- `creator_fee_usd`: The amount of fees paid to the NFT collection as royalty payments for this NFT event in US dollars.\n- `tx_fee`: The gas fee for this transaction in ETH.\n- `tx_fee_usd`: The gas fee for this transaction in US dollars.\n\n`ethereum.core.nft_metadata`:\n- `blockchain`: Blockchain where NFT is from, in this table only `ethereum`.\n- `commission_rate`: Royalty rate for NFT sales.\n- `contract_name`: Name of the contract address.\n- `created_at_timestamp`: The block timestamp at which the project was created.\n- `created_at_tx_hash`: The tx hash at which the project was created.\n- `creator_address`: The address of the creator of the NFT contract.\n- `creator_name`: The name of the address that created the NFT contract.\n- `image_url`: Link to NFT image.\n- `project_name`: Name of NFT project.\n- `token_id`: Token ID of the NFT contract.\n- `token_metadata`: The metadata for the NFT contract.\n- `token_name`: The name of the NFT contract.\n\nAs for queries to explore the data, I can certainly help you with that.
