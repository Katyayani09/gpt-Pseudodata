The first table contains NFT events on the Ethereum blockchain, with columns such as block number, block timestamp, transaction hash, event type, platform name, seller and buyer addresses, NFT contract address, token ID, price, fees, and more. The second table contains metadata for popular NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain, with columns such as blockchain, commission rate, contract name, creator address, image URL, project name, token ID, and more.","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"},{"timestamp":1682375752166,"username":"jlcote2","content":"Can you explain more about the block number column in the first table?","type":"human","userId":"1098959367711232062"},{"timestamp":1682375753166,"username":"Erin","content":"Sure! The block number column in the first table refers to the block number at which the NFT event occurred on the Ethereum blockchain. Each block contains a set of transactions, and the block number is a unique identifier for that block. By recording the block number of an NFT event, we can track when it occurred and in what order it occurred relative to other events on the blockchain.","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"},{"timestamp":1682375770713,"username":"tsandt","content":"Query to find all the historical sales of a particular NFT along with the date, price","type":"human","userId":"1100091708898807808"},{"timestamp":1682375771713,"username":"Erin","content":"Sure! To find all the historical sales of a particular NFT along with the date and price, you can use the first table and filter by the NFT contract address and event type `sale`. You can then select the `block_timestamp` and `price` columns to get the date and price of each sale. Here's an example query:\n\n```\nSELECT block_timestamp, price\nFROM nft_events\nWHERE nft_address = '0x123abc...' AND event_type = 'sale';\n```\n\nJust replace `0x123abc...` with the actual contract address of the NFT you're interested in.","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"},{"timestamp":1682375851480,"username":"jlcote2","content":"what are the datatypes of the columns block timestamp, blockchain, and creator address?","type":"human","userId":"1098959367711232062"},{"timestamp":1682375852480,"username":"Erin","content":"Sure!

The different types of NFT sales events in the first table are `sale`, `bid_won`, and `redeem`. The `sale` event type refers to a direct sale of an NFT, while the `bid_won` event type refers to a successful bid on an NFT auction. The `redeem` event type refers to the redemption of an NFT from a platform or exchange.","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"},{"timestamp":1682375964276,"username":"zschleimer","content":"Can you give you a list of queries to explore the data?","type":"human","userId":"1098810644448415885"},{"timestamp":1682375965276,"username":"Erin","content":"Sure!
