However, I need to clarify that the `commission rate` and `price` columns are only available in the `sales` table, while the `blockchain`, `contract name`, `creator address`, `image URL`, `project name`, and `token ID` columns are only available in the `metadata` table. Therefore, you will need to join these two tables to get all the columns you want. Here's an example SQL query that should do what you're looking for:\n\n```\nSELECT m.blockchain, m.commission_rate, m.contract_name, m.creator_address, m.image_url, m.project_name, m.token_id, s.price\nFROM metadata m\nLEFT JOIN sales s ON m.tokenid = s.tokenid AND m.blockchain = 'ethereum' AND s.event_type = 'sale'\nORDER BY m.project_name ASC;\n```\n\nThis query will select the `blockchain`, `commission rate`, `contract name`, `creator address`, `image URL`, `project name`, `token ID`, and `price` columns from the `metadata` and `sales` tables, joining them on the `tokenid` column. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all rows from the `metadata` table are included in the result, even if there are no matching rows in the `sales` table. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include NFTs from the Ethereum blockchain that have been sold (`event_type = 'sale'`).
