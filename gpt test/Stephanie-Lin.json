The first table contains NFT events on the Ethereum blockchain, and the second table contains metadata for popular NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nHere's a brief description of the columns in the first table:\n- block_number: The block number at which the NFT event occurred.\n- block_timestamp: The block timestamp at which the NFT event occurred.\n- tx_hash: The transaction hash for the NFT event. This is not necessarily unique in this table as a transaction may contain multiple NFT events.\n- event_type: The type of NFT event in this transaction, either `sale`, `bid_won` or `redeem`.\n- platform_address: The address of the exchange used for the transaction.\n- platform_name: The name of the exchange used for the trade. Currently, the exchanges supported are `opensea`, `looksrare`, `larva labs`, `blur`, `rarible`, `x2y2`, `sudoswap`, and `nftx`.\n- seller_address: The address of the seller of the NFT in the transaction.\n- buyer_address: The address of the buyer of the NFT in the transaction.\n- nft_address: The contract address of the NFT.\n- project_name: The name of the NFT project. This field, along with metadata, will be filled in over time.\n- tokenid: The token ID for this NFT contract.\n- token_metadata: The token metadata for this NFT. This may be blank for many NFTs. We are working to expand this field.\n- currency_symbol: The token symbol for this NFT event.\n- currency_address: The token contract address for this NFT event. This will be `ETH` for native ETH transactions.\n- price: The amount of the NFT event in the currency in which the transaction occurred, decimal adjusted where possible.\n- price_usd: The amount of the NFT event in US dollars. This will be 0 for tokens without a decimal adjustment or hourly price.\n- total_fees: The total amount of fees paid relating to the NFT purchase in the transaction currency. This includes royalty payments to creators and platform fees. Please note, this does not include the gas fee.\n- platform_fee: The decimal adjusted amount of fees paid to the platform for this NFT event in the transaction's currency.\nHere are some queries you can use to explore the data in the first table:\n- Find all NFT events that occurred on the Opensea platform.\n- Find the total amount of fees paid for all NFT purchases in US dollars.\n- Find the top 10 NFT projects by total sales volume in ETH.\n- Find the average price of NFTs sold on the Rarible platform.\n- Find the number of NFTs sold by each seller address.\n- Find the number of NFTs bought by each buyer address.\n\nAnd here's a brief description of the columns in the second table:\n- blockchain: Blockchain where NFT is from, in this table only `ethereum`.\n- commission_rate: Royalty rate for NFT sales.\n- contract_name: Name of the contract address.\n- created_at_timestamp: The block timestamp at which the project was created.\n- created_at_tx_hash: The tx hash at which the project was created.\n- creator_address: The address of the creator of the NFT contract.\n- creator_name: The name of the address that created the NFT contract.\n- image_url: Link to NFT image.\n- project_name: Name of NFT project.\n- token_id: Token ID of the NFT contract.\n- token_metadata: The metadata for the NFT contract.\n- token_name: The name of the NFT contract.\n\nHere are some queries you can use to explore the data in the second table:\n- Find all NFT projects created by a specific creator address.\n- Find the top 10 NFT projects by total sales volume in ETH.\n- Find all NFT projects with a commission rate greater than 10%.\n- Find the number of NFTs sold for each NFT project.\n- Find the average price of NFTs sold for each NFT project.","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"},{"timestamp":1682375561469,"username":"StephanieLin","content":"Rewrite these queries in sql which can be run on flipside","type":"human","userId":"527922224192290826"},{"timestamp":1682375562469,"username":"Erin","content":"Sure, here are some example SQL queries that you can run on Flipside to explore the data in the first table:\n\n-- Find all NFT events that occurred on the Opensea platform.\nSELECT *\nFROM nft_events\nWHERE platform_name = 'opensea';\n\n-- Find the total amount of fees paid for all NFT purchases in US dollars.\nSELECT SUM(total_fees_usd)\nFROM nft_events;\n\n-- Find the top 10 NFT projects by total sales volume in ETH.\nSELECT project_name, SUM(price)\nFROM nft_events\nGROUP BY project_name\nORDER BY SUM(price) DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n\n-- Find the average price of NFTs sold on the Rarible platform.\nSELECT AVG(price)\nFROM nft_events\nWHERE platform_name = 'rarible';\n\n-- Find the number of NFTs sold by each seller address.\nSELECT seller_address, COUNT(*)\nFROM nft_events\nGROUP BY seller_address;\n\n-- Find the number of NFTs bought by each buyer address.\nSELECT buyer_address, COUNT(*)\nFROM nft_events\nGROUP BY buyer_address;\n\nAnd here are some example SQL queries that you can run on Flipside to explore the data in the second table:\n\n-- Find all NFT projects created by a specific creator address.\nSELECT *\nFROM nft_metadata\nWHERE creator_address = '0x1234567890abcdef';\n\n-- Find the top 10 NFT projects by total sales volume in ETH.\nSELECT project_name, SUM(price)\nFROM nft_events\nJOIN nft_metadata ON nft_events.nft_address = nft_metadata.contract_name\nGROUP BY project_name\nORDER BY SUM(price) DESC\nLIMIT 10;\n\n-- Find all NFT projects with a commission rate greater than 10%.\nSELECT *\nFROM nft_metadata\nWHERE commission_rate > 0.1;\n\n-- Find the number of NFTs sold for each NFT project.\nSELECT project_name, COUNT(*)\nFROM nft_events\nJOIN nft_metadata ON nft_events.nft_address = nft_metadata.contract_name\nGROUP BY project_name;\n\n-- Find the average price of NFTs sold for each NFT project.\nSELECT project_name, AVG(price)\nFROM nft_events\nJOIN nft_metadata ON nft_events.nft_address = nft_metadata.contract_name\nGROUP BY project_name;","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"},{"timestamp":1682375763046,"username":"StephanieLin","content":"Write the top 10 most insightful SQL queries for each table for exploration.","type":"human","userId":"527922224192290826"},{"timestamp":1682375764046,"username":"Erin","content":"Sure, here are some example SQL queries that you can run on Flipside to explore the data in each table:\n\nFor the first table:\n\n1.
