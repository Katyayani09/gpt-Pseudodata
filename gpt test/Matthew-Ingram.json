To find the most profitable NFT token in 2021, we need to join the NFT events table with the metadata table on the `nft_address` and `tokenid` columns. Then we can group by `nft_address` and `tokenid` and sum the `price_usd` column to get the total USD value of sales for each NFT token. We can then order the results by the total USD value in descending order and limit the results to the top 1. However, keep in mind that this query will only give us the most profitable NFT token based on sales data, and does not take into account other factors such as rarity or popularity.","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"},{"timestamp":1682375694087,"username":"MatthewIngram","content":"can you give me the SQL query instead","type":"human","userId":"1012146344690991114"},{"timestamp":1682375695087,"username":"Erin","content":"Sure!
