Here are some example queries you can use with the `core__ez_nft_sales` table:\n\n1. To get the total number of NFT sales on OpenSea:\n```\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM core__ez_nft_sales WHERE platform_name = 'opensea' AND event_type = 'sale';\n```\n\n2. To get the total amount of fees paid in USD for NFT sales on Rarible:\n```\nSELECT SUM(total_fees_usd) FROM core__ez_nft_sales WHERE platform_name = 'rarible' AND event_type = 'sale';\n```\n\n3. To get the average price of NFT sales on Sudoswap:\n```\nSELECT AVG(price) FROM core__ez_nft_sales WHERE platform_name = 'sudoswap' AND event_type = 'sale';\n```\n\nAs for the `core__dim_nft_metadata` table, here are some example queries:\n\n1. To get the name and image URL of a specific NFT project:\n```\nSELECT project_name, image_url FROM core__dim_nft_metadata WHERE project_name = 'My NFT Project';\n```\n\n2. To get the commission rate for a specific NFT contract:\n```\nSELECT commission_rate FROM core__dim_nft_metadata WHERE contract_address = '0x1234567890abcdef';\n```\n\n3. To get the total number of NFTs in a specific project:\n```\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM core__dim_nft_metadata WHERE project_name = 'My NFT Project';\n```\n\nI hope these examples help!
