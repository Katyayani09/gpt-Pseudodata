To see the relation between `aggregator_name` and `total_fees_usd`, we need to join the table containing NFT events with the table containing metadata for popular NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain. We can use the `platform_name` column in the NFT events table to join with the `project_name` column in the NFT collections metadata table. Then, we can group by `platform_name` and sum the `total_fees_usd` column to get the total fees paid for each platform.","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"},{"timestamp":1682376789538,"username":"DavidWalton","content":"what does this error mean \"OperationFailedError: SQL compilation error: error line 1 at position 22 'EZ_NFT_SALES.PLATFORM_FEE_USD' in select clause is neither an aggregate nor in the group by clause.\"","type":"human","userId":"646514660354293770"},{"timestamp":1682376790538,"username":"Erin","content":"This error means that you are trying to select the `platform_fee_usd` column without including it in the `GROUP BY` clause or using an aggregate function like `SUM()`. In SQL, when you use a `GROUP BY` clause, you can only select columns that are either included in the `GROUP BY` clause or are being aggregated using a function like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`, etc. To fix this error, you can either include `platform_fee_usd` in the `GROUP BY` clause or use an aggregate function to calculate the sum of `platform_fee_usd`.","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"}]}]
