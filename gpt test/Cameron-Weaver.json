You can write many more \n\n1. What is the schema of the tables (with description)? Ask for explanations of the different columns (Verify with the documentation links above)? Maybe ask GPT to give you a list of queries to explore the data, and then ask it for the queries.  \n\n2. Ask for the datatypes of the columns you are interested in? \n\n3. There are different types of NFT sales events. Find out the types. \n\n4. How to find the highest priced NFT (token) in the sales table, for a particular project_name.\n\n5. Query to find all the historical sales of a particular NFT along with the date, price (in eth and USD) of the sale\n\n \n\nSTEP 2 -Try queries in Flipside and see if they work. Things to watch out for:\n\n1. The table names in GPT and Flipside are different. When executing the queries, you would need to cross-check and replace the table names.

What is the schema of the tables (with description)? Ask for explanations of the different columns (Verify with the documentation links above)? Maybe ask GPT to give you a list of queries to explore the data, and then ask it for the queries.\n\n- You can use the schema provided in the documentation to understand the tables and their columns. If you have any questions about the columns, you can ask me and I'll do my best to explain them. If you want to explore the data further, you can ask GPT to generate some sample queries for you to run.\n\n2.
