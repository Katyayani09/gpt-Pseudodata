There are three types of NFT sales events in the `nft_events` table: `sale`, `bid_won`, and `redeem`. \n\nA `sale` event occurs when an NFT is sold for a certain price, while a `bid_won` event occurs when a bidder wins an auction for an NFT. A `redeem` event occurs when an NFT is redeemed, which typically means that the NFT was previously locked up in a smart contract and is now being released.","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"},{"timestamp":1682375961875,"username":"GinaRamirez","content":"What information can I get about the NFT transaction from the table","type":"human","userId":"1098882632735010818"},{"timestamp":1682375962875,"username":"Erin","content":"The `nft_events` table contains a lot of information about NFT transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

It was created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin and has since become one of the most popular blockchain platforms in the world. Ethereum is known for its ability to execute smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts allow for the creation of decentralized applications, which can be used for a wide range of purposes, from financial transactions to supply chain management to gaming and more.","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"},{"timestamp":1682376659030,"username":"GinaRamirez","content":"Explain the schema of the metadata table","type":"human","userId":"1098882632735010818"},{"timestamp":1682376660030,"username":"Erin","content":"The metadata table contains information about popular NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain.
