In this case, you can focus on the `price` column, which will give you the amount of the NFT event in the currency in which the transaction occurred. If you need to convert the `price` to USD, you can use an external API or service that provides exchange rates for the currency used in the transaction. You can then multiply the `price` by the exchange rate to get the USD value. Keep in mind that this will only give you an estimate of the USD value, as exchange rates can fluctuate over time.","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"},{"timestamp":1682377048150,"username":"AngelEaton","content":"how can I find the most Notable Pepes transaction?","type":"human","userId":"858882261381283880"},{"timestamp":1682377049150,"username":"Erin","content":"To find the most notable Pepes transaction, you can use the following SQL query:\n\n```\nSELECT *\nFROM sales\nWHERE project_name = 'Pepe'\nORDER BY total_fees_usd DESC\nLIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis will return the transaction with the highest total fees paid in USD for the Pepe project.
