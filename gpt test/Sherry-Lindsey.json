Explain  different columns ?","type":"human","userId":"952654173374128158"},{"timestamp":1682376324069,"username":"Erin","content":"Sure, I can help you with that! The table `ethereum.core.ez_nft_sales` contains information about NFT events on the Ethereum blockchain. Here's a breakdown of the different columns:\n\n- `block_number`: This column contains the block number at which the NFT event occurred.\n- `block_timestamp`: This column contains the block timestamp at which the NFT event occurred.\n- `tx_hash`: This column contains the transaction hash for the NFT event. This is not necessarily unique in this table as a transaction may contain multiple NFT events.\n- `event_type`: This column contains the type of NFT event in this transaction, either `sale`, `bid_won` or `redeem`.\n- `platform_address`: This column contains the address of the exchange used for the transaction.\n- `platform_name`: This column contains the name of the exchange used for the trade. Currently, the exchanges supported are `opensea`, `looksrare`, `larva labs`, `blur`, `rarible`, `x2y2`, `sudoswap`, and `nftx`.\n- `seller_address`: This column contains the address of the seller of the NFT in the transaction.\n- `buyer_address`: This column contains the address of the buyer of the NFT in the transaction.\n- `nft_address`: This column contains the contract address of the NFT.\n- `project_name`: This column contains the name of the NFT project. This field, along with metadata, will be filled in over time.\n- `tokenid`: This column contains the token ID for this NFT contract.\n- `token_metadata`: This column contains the token metadata for this NFT. This may be blank for many NFTs. We are working to expand this field.\n- `currency_symbol`: This column contains the token symbol for this NFT event.\n- `currency_address`: This column contains the token contract address for this NFT event. This will be `ETH` for native ETH transactions.\n- `price`: This column contains the amount of the NFT event in the currency in which the transaction occurred, decimal adjusted where possible.\n- `price_usd`: This column contains the amount of the NFT event in US dollars. This will be 0 for tokens without a decimal adjustment or hourly price.\n- `total_fees`: This column contains the total amount of fees paid relating to the NFT purchase in the transaction currency. This includes royalty payments to creators and platform fees. Please note, this does not include the gas fee.\n- `platform_fee`: This column contains the decimal adjusted amount of fees paid to the platform for this NFT event in the transaction's currency.\n- `creator_fee`: This column contains the decimal adjusted amount of fees paid to the NFT collection as royalty payments for this NFT event in the transaction's currency.\n- `total_fees_usd`: This column contains the total amount of fees paid relating to the NFT purchase in US dollars. This includes royalty payments to creators and platform fees. Please note, this does not include the gas fee.\n- `platform_fee_usd`: This column contains the amount of fees paid to the platform for this NFT event in US dollars.\n- `creator_fee_usd`: This column contains the amount of fees paid to the NFT collection as royalty payments for this NFT event in US dollars.\n- `tx_fee`: This column contains the gas fee for this transaction in ETH.\n- `tx_fee_usd`: This column contains the gas fee for this transaction in US dollars.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about any of these columns!","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"},{"timestamp":1682376477373,"username":"SherryLindsey","content":"what could be the possible queries that can drive business sense from both table that is ethereum.core.ez_nft_sales\nand\nethereum.core.dim_nft_metadata","type":"human","userId":"952654173374128158"},{"timestamp":1682376478373,"username":"Erin","content":"Great question! There are many queries that could be used to drive business insights from these tables. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. Find the top 10 NFT projects by total sales volume in USD.\n    - To answer this question, we would need to join the `ez_nft_sales` and `dim_nft_metadata` tables on the `nft_address` and `tokenid` columns. Then, we could group by `project_name` and sum the `price_usd` column to get the total sales volume for each project. Finally, we could sort by the total sales volume and limit the results to the top 10.\n\n2. Calculate the average platform fee as a percentage of the total fees for each exchange.\n    - To answer this question, we would need to group the `ez_nft_sales` table by `platform_name` and calculate the average `platform_fee` as a percentage of the total fees (`total_fees`). We could also add a filter to only include sales where the `event_type` is `sale`.\n\n3. Find the top 10 NFT creators by total sales volume in USD.\n    - To answer this question, we would need to join the `ez_nft_sales` and `dim_nft_metadata` tables on the `nft_address` and `tokenid` columns. Then, we could group by `creator_address` and sum the `price_usd` column to get the total sales volume for each creator.
