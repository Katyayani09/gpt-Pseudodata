The schema for the NFT events table includes columns for block number, block timestamp, transaction hash, event type, platform address, platform name, seller address, buyer address, NFT address, project name, token ID, token metadata, currency symbol, currency address, price, price in USD, total fees, platform fee, creator fee, total fees in USD, platform fee in USD, creator fee in USD, transaction fee in ETH, and transaction fee in USD. The schema for the NFT collections table includes columns for blockchain, commission rate, contract name, created at timestamp, created at tx hash, creator address, creator name, image URL, project name, token ID, token metadata, and token name.\n\n2. To find the data types of specific columns, you can use the `DESCRIBE` command followed by the table name and column name. For example, to find the data type of the `block_number` column in the NFT events table, you can use the following command: `DESCRIBE nft_events.block_number;`\n\n3. The different types of NFT sales events are `sale`, `bid_won`, and `redeem`.\n\n4. To find the highest priced NFT (token) in the sales table for a particular `project_name`, you can use the following query: \n\n```\nSELECT MAX(price) \nFROM nft_events \nWHERE event_type = 'sale' AND project_name = 'your_project_name';\n```\n\nReplace `your_project_name` with the name of the project you're interested in.\n\n5. To find all the historical sales of a particular NFT along with the date, price (in ETH and USD) of the sale, you can use the following query:\n\n```\nSELECT block_timestamp, price, price_usd \nFROM nft_events \nWHERE event_type = 'sale' AND project_name = 'your_project_name' AND tokenid = 'your_token_id';\n```\n\nReplace `your_project_name` with the name of the project you're interested in, and `your_token_id` with the ID of the token you're interested in.","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"}]}]
