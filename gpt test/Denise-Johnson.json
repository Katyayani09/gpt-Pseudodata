In parallel look at Step 2 as well. \n\nFor the activity, you need to ask the GPT questions to help you understand the tables and write SQL queries for the same. Here are some sample questions that can help you understand the tables and explore the data. You should also look at the documentation above as needed but use GPT as much as possible.  You can write many more \n\n1. What is the schema of the tables (with description)? Ask for explanations of the different columns (Verify with the documentation links above)? Maybe ask GPT to give you a list of queries to explore the data, and then ask it for the queries.  \n\n2. Ask for the datatypes of the columns you are interested in? \n\n3. There are different types of NFT sales events. Find out the types. \n\n4. How to find the highest priced NFT (token) in the sales table, for a particular project_name.\n\n5. Query to find all the historical sales of a particular NFT along with the date, price (in eth and USD) of the sale","type":"human","userId":"1099136666695909487"},{"timestamp":1682375671195,"username":"Erin","content":"Great!

The NFT events table contains information about NFT events on the Ethereum blockchain. Here are the different columns and their descriptions:\n\n- block_number: The block number at which the NFT event occurred.\n- block_timestamp: The block timestamp at which the NFT event occurred.\n- tx_hash: The transaction hash for the NFT event. This is not necessarily unique in this table as a transaction may contain multiple NFT events.\n- event_type: The type of NFT event in this transaction, either `sale`, `bid_won` or `redeem`.\n- platform_address: The address of the exchange used for the transaction.\n- platform_name: The name of the exchange used for the trade. Currently, the exchanges supported are `opensea`, `looksrare`, `larva labs`, `blur`, `rarible`, `x2y2`, `sudoswap`, and `nftx`.\n- seller_address: The address of the seller of the NFT in the transaction.\n- buyer_address: The address of the buyer of the NFT in the transaction.\n- nft_address: The contract address of the NFT.\n- project_name: The name of the NFT project. This field, along with metadata, will be filled in over time.\n- tokenid: The token ID for this NFT contract.\n- token_metadata: The token metadata for this NFT. This may be blank for many NFTs. We are working to expand this field.\n- currency_symbol: The token symbol for this NFT event.\n- currency_address: The token contract address for this NFT event. This will be `ETH` for native ETH transactions.\n- price: The amount of the NFT event in the currency in which the transaction occurred, decimal adjusted where possible.\n- price_usd: The amount of the NFT event in US dollars. This will be 0 for tokens without a decimal adjustment or hourly price.\n- total_fees: The total amount of fees paid relating to the NFT purchase in the transaction currency. This includes royalty payments to creators and platform fees. Please note, this does not include the gas fee.\n- platform_fee: The decimal adjusted amount of fees paid to the platform for this NFT event in the transaction's currency.\n- creator_fee: The decimal adjusted amount of fees paid to the NFT collection as royalty payments for this NFT event in the transaction's currency.\nThe metadata table contains the metadata for popular NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain. Here are the different columns and their descriptions:\n\n- blockchain: Blockchain where NFT is from, in this table only `ethereum`.\n- commission_rate: Royalty rate for NFT sales.\n- contract_name: Name of the contract address.\n- created_at_timestamp: The block timestamp at which the project was created.\n- created_at_tx_hash: The tx hash at which the project was created.\n- creator_address: The address of the creator of the NFT contract.\n- creator_name: The name of the address that created the NFT contract.\n- image_url: Link to NFT image.\n- project_name: Name of NFT project.\n- token_id: Token ID of the NFT contract.\n- token_metadata: The metadata for the NFT contract.\n- token_name: The name of the NFT contract.","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"},{"timestamp":1682375855529,"username":"DeniseJohnson","content":"What are the datatypes of the columns that we are interested in?","type":"human","userId":"1099136666695909487"},{"timestamp":1682375856529,"username":"Erin","content":"Sure!

The data in these tables can be used to gain insights into the NFT market on the Ethereum blockchain. The `nft_events` table contains information about NFT sales, bids, and redemptions, including the price of the NFT, the addresses of the buyer and seller, and the fees paid. This data can be used to analyze trends in the NFT market, such as which projects are selling the most NFTs, which platforms are the most popular for NFT sales, and how much buyers are willing to pay for NFTs.\n\nThe `nft_metadata` table contains metadata for popular NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain, including the name of the project, the creator address, and the image URL. This data can be used to identify popular NFT collections and to analyze the characteristics of those collections, such as the commission rate and the token metadata.\n\nOverall, these tables provide a wealth of data that can be used to gain insights into the NFT market on the Ethereum blockchain and to inform investment decisions.","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"}]}]
