It has columns such as `block_number`, `block_timestamp`, `tx_hash`, `event_type`, `platform_address`, `platform_name`, `seller_address`, `buyer_address`, `nft_address`, `project_name`, `tokenid`, `token_metadata`, `currency_symbol`, `currency_address`, `price`, `price_usd`, `total_fees`, `platform_fee`, `creator_fee`, `total_fees_usd`, `platform_fee_usd`, `creator_fee_usd`, `tx_fee`, and `tx_fee_usd`.\n\nThe `nft_metadata` table contains metadata for popular NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain. It has columns such as `blockchain`, `commission_rate`, `contract_name`, `created_at_timestamp`, `created_at_tx_hash`, `creator_address`, `creator_name`, `image_url`, `project_name`, `token_id`, `token_metadata`, and `token_name`.\n\nRegarding the different columns, `block_number` and `block_timestamp` represent the block number and timestamp at which the NFT event occurred. `tx_hash` represents the transaction hash for the NFT event. `event_type` represents the type of NFT event in this transaction, either `sale`, `bid_won` or `redeem`. `platform_address` represents the address of the exchange used for the transaction. `platform_name` represents the name of the exchange used for the trade. `seller_address` represents the address of the seller of the NFT in the transaction. `buyer_address` represents the address of the buyer of the NFT in the transaction. `nft_address` represents the contract address of the NFT. `project_name` represents the name of the NFT project. `tokenid` represents the token ID for this NFT contract. `token_metadata` represents the token metadata for this NFT. `currency_symbol` represents the token symbol for this NFT event. `currency_address` represents the token contract address for this NFT event. `price` represents the amount of the NFT event in the currency in which the transaction occurred. `price_usd` represents the amount of the NFT event in US dollars. `total_fees` represents the total amount of fees paid relating to the NFT purchase in the transaction currency. `platform_fee` represents the amount of fees paid to the platform forthis NFT event in the transaction's currency. `creator_fee` represents the decimal adjusted amount of fees paid to the NFT collection as royalty payments for this NFT event in the transaction's currency. `total_fees_usd` represents the total amount of fees paid relating to the NFT purchase in US dollars. `platform_fee_usd` represents the amount of fees paid to the platform for this NFT event in US dollars. `creator_fee_usd` represents the amount of fees paid to the NFT collection as royalty payments for this NFT event in US dollars. `tx_fee` represents the gas fee for this transaction in ETH. `tx_fee_usd` represents the gas fee for this transaction in US dollars.\n\nAs for queries to explore the data, here are a few examples:\n\n- To get the total number of NFT events in the table, you can use the following query:\n\n  `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nft_events;`\n\n- To get the total number of unique NFTs in the table, you can use the following query:\n\n  `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT nft_address, tokenid) AS unique_nfts FROM nft_events;`\n\n- To get the total number of NFT events by platform, you can use the following query:\n\n  `SELECT platform_name, COUNT(*) FROM nft_events GROUP BY platform_name;`\n\n- To get the total number of NFT events by event type, you can use the following query:\n\n  `SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) FROM nft_events GROUP BY event_type;`\n\n- To get the total number of NFT events by project name, you can use the following query:\n\n  `SELECT project_name, COUNT(*) FROM nft_events GROUP BY project_name;`\n\n- To get the total number of NFT events by currency symbol, you can use the following query:\n\n  `SELECT currency_symbol, COUNT(*) FROM nft_events GROUP BY currency_symbol;`\n\nI hope this helps!

Once you have the sales data, you can calculate the average using SQL's `AVG` function.

To find the NFT with the highest commission rate, you can use the `commission_rate` column in the `nft_metadata` table. You can use SQL's `MAX` function to find the highest commission rate, and then join the `nft_metadata` table with the `nft_events` table to get more information about the NFT. Here's an example query:\n\n```\nSELECT nm.*, ne.price, ne.currency_symbol\nFROM nft_metadata nm\nJOIN nft_events ne ON nm.token_id = ne.tokenid\nWHERE nm.commission_rate = (SELECT MAX(commission_rate) FROM nft_metadata)\n```\n\nThis query will return all columns from the `nft_metadata` table, as well as the `price` and `currency_symbol` columns from the `nft_events` table for the NFT with the highest commission rate.\n\nKeep in mind that the `nft_metadata` table only contains metadata for popular NFT collections, so this query will only return results for NFTs in those collections.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!","type":"response","userId":"1061786628726734929"}]}]
